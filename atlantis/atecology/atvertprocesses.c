 \brief C file for vertebrate subroutines for south east ecological model
 \ingroup atecology

 File:	atvertprocesses.c
 Author:	Beth Fulton
 Created:	21/9/2004
 Purpose:	C file for vertebrate subroutines for south east ecological model
 Revisions: 8/8/2004 Created mseecomvert.c from the seecomvert.c file

 17/8/2004 Generalised and updated to reflect parameters now
 in bm->SP_prms and counters (e.g. bm->K_num_vert_sp) now
 in MSEBoxModel structure

 21/9/2004 Created atvertprocesses.c from mseecomvert.c. And renamed
 FSL, FSO, FSF, FST and FSG to generic names so apply to
 other models/generic case.
 FSL -> FDC  (Ling -> Demersal_DC_Fish)
 FSO -> FDO  (Orange_Roughy -> Demersal_O_Fish)
 FSF -> FDB  (Flathead -> Demersal_B_Fish)
 FST -> FVO  (Bluefin_Tuna -> Pisciv_O_Fish)
 FSG -> SHB  (Gummy_Shark -> Shark_B)

 22/9/2004 Replaced numbers in switch statements with id
 guild numbers. Also added Ricker reproduction equation
 and replaced Beverton-Holt reproduction case with more
 conventional representation.

 15/10/2004 Added BML and BFF.

 19/10/2004 Added Prawns

 24/10/2004 Added soft sediments

 26/10/2004 Added FBP, FVB, SP, FDE, FDF, SHR, SSK, REP, WDG

 27/10/2004 Added cohort distribution per age class (VERTpopratio)

 2/11/2004 Added standard Beverton Holt stock-recruitment curve

 7/12/2004 Added initialisation of RC and DEN entries in shiftVERT
 in Vert_Reproduction()

 25/3/2005 Added code so groups with age class < 1yr long don't get
 anomalously jagged growth curves (for record keeping purposes
 store last valid entry until new age class sweeps through that
 age record)

 7/4/2005 In Vertebrate_Reproduction() changed shiftVERT[] of youngest
 age class from 0 to a formula matching the shift for other age
 classes. Zero only works in the age classes are annual or less, if
 they span multiple years then the original formulation was acting like
 MASSIVE juvenile mortality

 1/9/2005 Added multiple stock structure (horizontal and vertical)

 2/9/2005 Moved KDENR to array to accomodate recruitment to multiple stocks

 22/9/2005 Added linear pupping (and calving) recruitment option for vertebrates

 25/9/2005 Added environmental forcing (from times series) option to vertebrate
 reproduction routine

 10/10/2005 Corrected typos to do with external reproduction code

 8/12/2005 Fixed error with "cohort within age class" aging. Basically
 the original version was updating after every layer so later layers
 were smooshed if earlier layers had no individuals in them (i.e.
 if strong depth stratification and strongly demersal). The fix was to
 add Update_Age_Distrib() and Update_RecAge_Distrib() so that the
 cohort distributions were recalculated at correct spatial scale.
 Also put in check so lowest age classes of single cohort
 year classes weren't emptied (as no recruits meant empty cohort meant
 a zero that then flowed through all cohorts). Lastly needed to add
 array so that cohort aging up to mature age classes is actually shifted
 in the Updated_Aged_Cohorts() (just before movement code is called).
 This was because in species with strong juvenile-adult splits that
 cohort was bing lost which then carried on in a ripple effect through
 the rest of the stock eventually. Use recruitRange and recruitRangeFlat
 to see steady transference of individuals to older age classes (this
 does dilute absolute strength of very high cohorts (year classes),
 but is justifiable given that the code is following the average size
 of the entire age phase/class and there can be a large variation in size
 across individuals of the same age.

 24/2/2006 Added code to Ecology_Update_Vertebrate_Cohorts() and Vertebrate_Reproduction()
 and agingMIG array to better handle aging when only part of the population
 is within the model domain (previous code only dealt with when both juveniles
 and adults were both outside or both inside the model domain at time of aging).

 11/4/2006 Corrected aging problem (shiftVERTON trigger mis-set so had been
 adding newly aged into next age, but not taking them away from the current
 age). Created Prepare_Age_Distrib() to handle distribution calculations
 ahead of time (because when the entire age class ages up there is nothing
 left to do the distributional calculations with!). Had to add AGEnewden and
 AGE_stock_struct_prop to allow for this information to be carried through
 until needed (probably could have overloaded newden and init_stock_struct_prop,
 but chose not to incase timing of events is rewritten in future and movement,
 which also uses newden etc happens between Prepare_age_Distrib() and
 Ecology_Update_Vertebrate_Cohorts().

 28/8/2006 Added recSTOCK array so that can have stock specific reproduction
 parameters.

 23/8/2007 Modified the plankton based recruitment equation from
 VERTembryo[species][stock_id] += recSTOCK[species][stock_id] * PP_sp * (CHLa / ref_chl)
 to
 VERTembryo[species][stock_id] += recSTOCK[species][stock_id] * PP_sp * bm->cell_vol * (CHLa / ref_chl)
 so the units of PP_sp are clearer (larvae support per unit chl)

 23/05/2008 Bec Gorton
 Using setInitalVertVectors(bm, Pool); in atbiolUtil to set the initial value of
 VERTinfo instead of setting the values for each functional group.

 26-05-2008 Bec Gorton
 Changed all references from bm->VERTind to the tracer arrays associated with
 each functional group.

 18/07/2008 Bec Gorton
 Changing the code within and called by Box_Bio_Process to use the temporary data
 stores in the EcologyModule instead of Pool and NetFLUX.

 20-01-2009 Bec Gorton
 Changed the DIET_check array to store habitat level information. This
 array is now in the atEcologyStruct and its contents are output to
 a seperate file called DietCheck.txt if the flagdietcheck flag is TRUE.

 21-01-2009 Bec Gorton
 Got rid of the jmQ_T15_id, jmL_T15_id and jmL_id and jmQ_id species parameters.
 These values are now stored in the juv_id slot in the cohortSpeciesParams array.

 03-02-2009 Bec Gorton
 Added additional debugging messages in Vert_Mortality.

 19-03-2009 Bec Gorton
 Changed the definition of the Do_Vertebrate_Living function to no longer
 expect the biomass of BO, BD, BC and MBsed - these were nor used anymore.

 10-06-2009 Bec Gorton
 Added some new debugging code to print out the spawning information for the
 which_check species if debugging is activated.

 10-06-2009 Bec Gorton
 Added the SEAGRASS invertebrate type.

 05-11-2009 Bec Gorton
 Trunk Merge 4064 - Changed the Vertebrate_Reproduction function to use the species specific
 value calculated in Parameter_Q10 instead of the general temp_influence.

 05-11-2009 Bec Gorton
 Trunk Merge 1126 - Added minimum size of reproduction for vertebrates

 14-12-2009 Bec Gorton
 Trunk merge 1425 - Added the calcMLinearMort, calcMQuadMort and calcMPredMort arrays to store different mortality values.

 02-02-2010 Bec Gorton
 Changed Do_Vertebrate_Living to return the total numbers instead of storing in totVert.

 01-03-2010 Bec Gorton
 Added code for vertebrate larval dispersion.

 04-05-2010 Bec Gorton
 Changed the Vertebrate_Assess_Enviro function to use the new Util_Get_Accumulative_Change_Scale to calculate the habitat
 scaling value for each habitat type. This could potentially change output as more than one scaling event can take
 place at any time.

 10-05-2010 Bec Gorton
 Got rid of the Ecology_Get_Species_LMort function. These calculation are now done in ParameterQ10.

 26-03-2011 Beth Fulton
 Added species specific starvation coefficients - mStarve

 13-07-2011 Beth Fulton
 Fixed a bug where there was an assignment of a value to current_layer rather than a test against the value of
 current_layer (i.e. used = instead of == on line 2098 in the vertebrate aging stuff)

 08-12-2012 Beth Fulton
 Replaced agingMIG with MIGRATION[sp].aging[cohort]

 17-04-2013 Bec Gorton
 ATL-346 - Added support of tracking P:N:C ratios in groups.
 
 8-05-2014 Beth Fulton
 Changed the DIET_check array to store diet information rather than a simple on/off check.
