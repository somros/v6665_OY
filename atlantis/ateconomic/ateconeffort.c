 \brief C file for effort allocation for economic models for Atlantis
 \ingroup ateconomic

 File:	ateconeffort.c
 Author:	Beth Fulton
 Created:	10/5/2006
 Purpose:	C file for effort allocation for economic models for Atlantis
 Revisions: 10/5/2006 Created the file (to split it away from ateconresponse.c)

 22/8/2006 Added check that only playing with effort allocation for
 fisheries using economically based effort model

 6/9/2006 To make loops faster skip over subfleets with no boats and fisheries
 where can't catch that actual group (i.e. when q == 0)

 7/9/2006 Initialisation of marginal rents and boatcatch necessary so not
 getting ridiculously small or large effort contributions

 8/9/2006 Made the currency of the economic model kg (which meant the TAC had
 to be updates as was previously in tonnes). This means that BlacBook values
 are to be in kg, saleprice is in $/kg and QuotaAlloc values are in kg.

 25/11/2006 Went from the option of rescaling all months to current month only.

 20/2/2007 Added Dan Holland effort allocation model - using bm->MultiPlanEffort
 to direct code to correct pathway. The bulk of the code is in Allocate_Final_Effort()

 14-04-2008 Beth Fulton
 Caught an sp call outside of a loop (so was greater than size of array) and initialisation
 that should have been in a loop that was being done just before it. Both in Dan Holland's code.

 15-04-2008 Beth Fulton
 When first calculating expected catch added += as = only set it to last value. Also
 removed (totland > maxland) check for BiTac cas of correcting for maximum allowable catch.

 16-04-2008 Beth Fulton
 In Dan Holland code: fixed marginal rent calculation (made price calc species specific contributions),
 made initial catch distribution in terms of kg not mg

 6-06-2008 Beth Fulton
 In Dan Holland code: capped the catch that can be expected based on hold size (quotas didn't work if
 species not under quota). Also changed ECONexprice calculation to market - quota price so don't
 get inappropriate compounding losses.

 28-10-2009 Bec Gorton
 Removed references to the K_num_fished_sp and K_num_impacted_sp. Arrays that were this
 size have been resized to K_num_tot_sp.

 04-11-2009 Bec Gorton
 Merged in Beths new bycatch incentive code.

 7-04-2010 Beth Fulton
 Taxes included in effort calculations

 *
 *	\brief Monthly Effort Allocation
 *
 *	Resets any monthly stuff. Doesn't do it if we are replaying history.
 *
 *	Looks at what is the ratio of expected catch of rest of year and what its already caught
 *	Looks are targeting information - what group its going to target. What its catching the most of its going to more heavily weight.
 *
 *	Weights by the number of species you have. More species means effort can be spread.
 *
 *	Effort increased are capped to you can't go to high to quickly .
 *
 *	Will recalculated deemed values and taxes.
 *
 *	If you do need to rescale effort for the remaining months of year.
 *		For remaining months
 *		 	What is expected catch and bycatch and recalculates the effort for each month.
 *			This is similar to the annual effor calculations.
 *
 *	Tax and deemed value takes into account bycatch and catch over quota.
 *
 *	Then created new expected effort. What does this mean cost wise, will i be in too much debt.
 *
 *	Then checks for it need to do to rescale effort - just magnitude of effort per month.
 *	Expected profits, and check effort isn't too high.
 *	Is debt too high identify boats that are to high. If past amount of time debt is tolerated boat is take out
 *	of the fleet. Proportion of the fleet is being tied up not an actual boat. This is prorata step.
 *	Assumption is that boats will go out lots and some will tie up.
 *
 *
 *	Rescale spatial effort. Use same spatial proportion but rescale the values in each box.
