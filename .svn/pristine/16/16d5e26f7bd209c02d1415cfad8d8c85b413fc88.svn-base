 Based on work by Ouyang and Fulton for Port Phillip Bay

 Note:
 1. Some names of variables or subroutines are self-explaining.
 2. In the names or comments, WC means Water Column, Sm Sediment.

 Revisions: 10/8/2004 Created from the msebiolsetup.c file

 17/8/2004 Moved all the management and effort arrays and parameters here
 except for FISHERY_prms which is created and initialised in
 atlantismain.c

 21/9/2004 Renamed FSL, FSO, FSF, FST and FSG to generic names so apply to
 other models/generic case.
 FSL -> FDC  (Ling -> Demersal_DC_Fish)
 FSO -> FDO  (Orange_Roughy -> Demersal_O_Fish)
 FSF -> FDB  (Flathead -> Demersal_B_Fish)
 FST -> FVO  (Bluefin_Tuna -> Pisciv_O_Fish)
 FSG -> SHB  (Gummy_Shark -> Shark_B)

 4/10/2004 Added parameter read-ins and array initalisation for
 new fisheries (ptrawlPWN, dtrawlFBP, midwcZL, trapFDE,
 dlineFDE, netFDE) and biological groups (BML, BFF, ZL, PWN,
 FBP, FDE, FDF, FVB, SSK, SHR, SP, REP, WDG)

 23/10/2004 Added midwcPWN and additional fisheries links

 18/1/2005 Added bm->FisheriesID and moved all sp_fisheries to nfisheries
 in readModelFCParameter() and modified initManage() tomatch for
 the parameter arrays where reading in species specific parameters
 foreach fishery (so now read in an entry for every fishery and then
 use bm->FisheriesID tomap to valid fisheries). Also modfified age specific
 selectivity to match (so read in adult and juvenile arrays for
 this parameter and then match with correct entry in overall parameter
 array).

 19/1/2005 Added Microphytobenthos (MB)

 8/6/2005 Added mowMA and moved target list from setDemPelFCID() to
 readFCModelParameter(). Also added readFCTargetValue() to read
 in strings of target species ids and added the 3 groups FDM, FDP, WHS.

 15/8/2005 Updated SPtoCATid to include all species now accessible by fisheries
 (either as target or bycatch)

 16/8/2005 Replaced numbers in readFCValue calls with read-in type id numbers (no_checking,
 binary_check, proportion_check, probability_check, integer_check). Also put
 in default case for all switch statements

 24/8/2005 Added basket quotas and started adding multiple stock structure and
 RegionalData so can have regional management, such as regional TACs. Also
 modified how MPAs read in so can have unlimioted number of rotational
 and changing MPAs. Readin via Setup_MPA_Lists()

 1/9/2005 Finished adding multiple stock structure (horizontal and vertical)

 27/9/2005 Added catch and effort time series usage

 17/8/2006 Fixed bug with Fcocatch array where reading it in as int not double
 so always effectively set to zero (in effect)

 5/9/2006 Removed limitation on fisheries per group, so did away
 with references to bm->FisheriesID and Fisheries_Indices. Kept
 as legacy code for now, but will ultimately be done away with.

 14/02/2008 - Bec Gorton

 Started moving the array loading code into functions. Following the standard format
 of using regular expressions for arrays.
 The manage code is being changed to use regular expressions to match the keys in the
 input files. The keys are also added to a hash table.
 When a key is matched to a regular expression it is also found in the has table.
 Each key is stored with a flag that is set to true when it is found in the input file.
 After the entire file is read the array of keys is checked to make sure they were all
 read in. If not an error message is printed and the program quits.

 The regular expressions and their associated functions are in atmanageRegEx.c.
 The hash table is generated in atmanageHashTable.c

 14/04/2008 Beth Fulton
 Added Kreg check so RegionalData array doesn't overflow if lots of regions.
 Also corrected bim to bm->BiM.

 26-05-2008 Bec Gorton
 Changed all references from bm->VERTind to the tracer arrays associated with
 each functional group.

 4/06/2008 Beth Fulton
 Removed Fisheries_Indices and FisheriesID as redundant in the new fully flexible structure

 30/09/2008 Bec Gorton
 Removed the bm->sp_Prms array. These values are now stored in the speciesParams
 and cohortSpeciesParams arrays in the FunctGroupArray structure.

 6/12/2008 Beth Fulton
 Added tEnd_id and tStart_id so can have start and end date for dynamic fisheries

 22-04-2009 Bec Gorton
 Removed the  bm->SPtoGUILD and bm->GUILDtoSP arrays. Also fixed some memory freeing
 code that was not freeing the memory arrays allocated when the management module is
 not turned on.

 16/6/2009 Beth Fulton
 Replaced SP_of_Concern[sp] with FunctGroupArray[sp].speciesParams[sp_concern_id]

 29-06-2009 Bec Gorton
 Moved the setupFisheryPrmStrings function into the new atHarvest module. These values
 are need when reading in the harvest input parameters.

 12-08-2009 Bec Gorton
 Change the
 origEffort_vdistrib = Util_Alloc_Init_2D_Double ( nfleets, bm->wcnz, 0.0 );
 to:
 origEffort_vdistrib = Util_Alloc_Init_2D_Double ( bm->wcnz, nfleets,  0.0 );
 so that i could use generic loading functions.

 28-10-2009 Bec Gorton
 Started removing references to K_num_fished_sp and K_num_impacted_sp.
 Change references to arrays that have been moved into a module structure.
 Change the input parsing code to use the new XML parsing code.

 02-11-2009 Bec Gorton
 Removed additional references to K_num_vert_sp, K_num_impacted_sp and K_num_fished_sp.

 03-11-2009 Bec Gorton
 Removed the readFCTargetValue() function and the declaration of the bm->SPtoCATid array.
 Also removed the readFCValue function.

 11/11/2009 Beth Fulton
 Added start_manage_id and end_manage_id so can have more flexible within run management options

 11/11/2009 Beth Fulton
 Added flagADJUSTmanage_id so can tie all forms of management (gear, spatial, effort, TAC, seasons)
 to stock size

 25-01-2010 Bec Gorton
 Got rid of the Not_fished_id definition. The basket_sp and companion species arrays will now be padded with -1
 values instead of Not_fished_id. The FunctGroupArray[sp].isFished value should also be checked to see if the companion/basket
 species is actually fished.

 29-01-2010 Bec Gorton
 Removed the bm->fisheryNAME - now using the fisheryCode in the fisheryArray.
 Renamed functions to comply with the coding standard.

 26-04-2010 Bec Gorton
 Fixed a bug in the code that reads in the Effort time series. The code was actually using the Effort
 time series.

 7-05-2010 Bec Gorton
 Deleted the setSPid function and the bm_>SPid array.

 05-05-2010 Bec Gorton
 Added code to initialise the new mFC_scale_id species fishery param. This is used to scale the mFC value
 when the broken stick management strategy is in use. The default value is 1.0 so it shouldn't have any effect
 when this is not turned on.

 25-05-2010 Beth Fulton
 Corrected  bm->SP_prms[b][spconcern_id] read-in as was point to [sp] not [b] originally

 01-02-2011 Beth Fulton
 Put in warning if no residuals for market (it used to cause a fail in econ code, but now just assumes
 zero residuals so warning needed here)

 03-10-2011 Beth Fulton
 Added tac_resetperiod_id read-in and initialised, plus added TotOldCumCatch[sp][nf] and TotOldCumDiscards[sp][nf] to deal with multiyear TAC

 11-10-2011 Beth Fulton
 Added a check whether bulkTAC and if it is (i.e. multiyear spanning TAC) then apply a multiplication of
 TACamt * tac_resetperiod_id length so that annual size TAC read-in converted to multi-year TAC
