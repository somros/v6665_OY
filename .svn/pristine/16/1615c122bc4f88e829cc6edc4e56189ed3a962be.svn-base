 File:           atlantisboxmodel.h

 Created:        Tue Sep 21 12:31:01 EST 2004

 Author:         Beth Fulton
 CSIRO Marine Research

 Purpose:        Include file for general purpose Box Model

 Revisions:      8/8/2004 mseboxm.h created from seboxm.h

 9/8/2004 All _ids moved here as defined constants

 12/8/2004 SP_prms array and other parameters arrays
 for biological, fisheries and management moved here
 from individual libraries.

 20/9/2004 Added assessment id numbers to definition section

 21/9/2004 Created msegenboxm.h from mseboxm.h. And renamed
 FSL, FSO, FSF, FST and FSG to generic names so apply to
 other models/generic case.
 FSL -> FDC
 FSO -> FDO
 FSF -> FDB
 FST -> FVO
 FSG -> SHB

 25/9/2004 Added extra id constants for new groups

 1/10/2004 Moved all invertbrate structural equivalency parameters (XX_sc)
 to core boxmodel (e.g. CEP_sc is now bm->CEP_sc) so assessment library
 can access them too

 23/10/2004 Added midwcPWN and additional fisheries links

 19/1/2005 Added Microphytobenthos (MB)

 28/3/2005 Added bm->do_availflag so that can do checks for active
 groups if only want active groups advected (so rounding errors
 don't add up to non-negligible flows in backwaters)

 29/3/2005 Added DIN_id etc so can track "stock size" of DIN

 8/4/2005 Added Invert_Activities() to handle mortality, growth,
 assimilation and waste equations in a general way

 9/4/2005 Added 	bm->INVERT_PREYeatenGlobal, bm->NutsProdGlobal,
 bm->NutsLostGlobal, bm->DetritusProdGlobal, bm->DetritusLostGlobal,
 bm->NutsProd, bm->NutsLost, bm->DetritusProd, bm->DetritusLost,
 created to simplify handling of handlgin of values spanning the
 it_count == 1 and subsequent iterations of the adaptive timestep.
 K_num_global_nonliving also added to facilitate loops through these
 vectors..

 10/4/2005 Added Primary_Production() to handle all primary production.
 Also added one_nut_lim to allow differentiation of those primary
 producers using one nutrient for limitation and those using
 multiple nutrients

 24/4/2005 Added constrain_wc

 13/7/2005 Added readkeyprm_darray_checked() and extended readValue()
 so that knows what data is expected so that can check on readin
 for obvious parameter errors

 19/7/2005 Added BDcat_id and MAcat_id and increased Not_fished_id from
 44 to 45 so BD now explicitly included in fished list.

 16/8/2005 Added stock_struct array, read-in type id numbers (no_checking,
 binary_check, proportion_check, probability_check, integer_check). Also
 added id numbers for some economics parameters

 24/9/2005 Added DebugFluxInfo and which_check and extra guild ids so can track
 specfic fluxes through time (helps in calibration with less fprintf
 statements

 25/9/2005 Added eflux and vflux to boxes data structure so can store flux values.
 Also added env_force time series (so can force recruitment with a TimeSeries
 file).

 22/12/2005 Added recruitRange params for re-written vertebrate aging


 17/04/2008 Bec Gorton
 Added a reference to atTracer.h.
 Also removed the move and migrate indices. These were used to
 refernence invertebrate arrays - they are no longer needed as the migration
 arrays have been resized to allow storage for all species regardless of if they
 migrate or not. A flag is now simply checked before the arrays are referenced.

 12/05/2008 Bec Gorton
 Added declarations of _isnan, _isfinite and isspace for linux.

 29/09/2008 Bec Gorton
 Removed the bm->sp_parms array. These are now stored in speciesParams and cohortSpeciesParams in the
 FunctGroup structure.
 Changed the parameters indices to be an enum that excluded the cohort dep parameters.
 These have been moved into a seperate cohort.

 19/10/2008 Bec Gorton
 Removed the bm->INVERT_PREYeatenGlobal and bm->INVERT_PREYeaten arrays. This data
 has been moved into the function group structured and resized to store habitat (WC, SED, EPI)
 data.

 03/11/2008 Bec Gorton
 Added the flux_thresh_id and flux_damp_id species params.

 2-02-2009 Beth Fulton
 Added new home range code.

 02-02-2009 Bec Gorton
 Simplified the code to add new species parameters. Also increased the number of species params
 to allow for the home range parameters.


 23-03-2009 Bec Gorton
 Moved the following arrays into the EcologyModule:

 double	***DebugInfo;	//< Array to store debug variable term values
 double **DebugFluxInfo; //< Array to store debug flux values

 07-04-2009 Bec Gorton
 Added the map projection parameter to the box model to handle the projection of the box model.
 This will allow us to calculate the number of day hours in a time step to accurately adjust the
 primary producer light limitation.

 The new lim_sun_hours has also be added. This is read in from the biology input file.


 22-04-2009 Bec Gorton
 Added each of the module header files to this file.
 Added the definitions:
 #define MAXSEDIMENTDEPTHSTR "100000"
 #define MAXSEDIMENTDEPTH 100000
 so that we can define the default depth boundaries of the epibenthic
 groups.

 Also added the following additional species params:
 age_structured_prey_id, KTUR_id, KIRR_id, vl_id, ht_id, KN_id, KS_id, KF_id, KI_T15_id,
 KI_id, KLYS_id, mD_id, mO_id, mS_id, mS_T15_id, KO2_id, KO2LIM_id,
 max_id, low_id, thresh_id, sat_id, min_depth_id, max_depth_id, flagchannel_id

 Added references to each of the module data structures in the BoxModel structure.
 Moved the definitions to the ecology functions that don't need to be globally defined such as Eat
 inte the atEcology module.


 02-06-2009 Bec Gorton
 Added support for log files to be rolled over when they get to a default size.
 By default the max size is MAX_LOG_FILE_SIZE 1.024e9. If the code is compiled
 with -D SMALL_LOG_FILE_SIZE then the max log file size is  MAX_LOG_FILE_SIZE 1.024e3.
 It was done this way to make for quicker testing - its easier to compare lots of small
 files instead of many really big files.

 10-06-2009 Bec Gorton
 Added the SEAGRASS invertebrate group.

 15-06-2009 Bec Gorton
 Changed the k_trans value to be a species parameter. The k_trans value is now used for the
 BFS, BFF and BFD values. For the rest of the groups 1.0 is used. Parse_File_Single_Line is used in convertAtlantis
 to create the new XML.

 02-07-2009 Bec Gorton
 Added the FC_case_id fishery parameters - the FC_case values will now be stored in bm->SP_FISHERYprms array.
 Added the harvestModuel structure to the box model structure.

 20-07-2009 Bec Gorton
 Added support for the user to provide more than one temperature and salinity input file.

 24-07-2009 Bec Gorton
 Changed the point source scaling to store a value per point source instead of a single mult, period and start
 value for all sources. Will require changes to input files - documented on the wiki.

 28-10-2009 Bec Gorton
 Added new species params that have been created. These were values that were stored in seperate arrays
 but could easily be moved into the speciesParam array.
 Also change the fishing params to be an enum instead of a set of #define values.

 30-10-2009 Bec Gorton
 Removed the K_num_invcohorts value.

 03-11-2009 Bec Gorton
 Removed the SPtoCATid array as these values are no longer required

 04-11-2009 Bec Gorton
 Merged in Beths fishing bycatch incentive code. - revision 961.

 05-11-2009 Bec Gorton
 Removed the #defined tot_prms value and added it to the end of the enum for
 the species params.
 Also changed the Subfleet (average vessel) characteristics and economic parameters value
 to be defined as a enum instead of #define values.

 10-11-2009 Bec Gorton
 Merged with trunk - revision 1423
 Added the calcMLinearMort, calcMQuadMort and calcMPredMort arrays to store different mortality values.

 15-12-2009 Bec Gorton
 Trunk merge 1437 - Added the atCLAMModule header file. Normally this would only be
 included in a win environment but for now it shall be included regardless of the environment.
 Also added an additional debugging option for the CLAM.

 29-01-2010 Bec Gorton
 Removed the fisheryNAME array. A number of variables and functions have been moved into the harvest
 and management libraries.

 03-02-2010 Bec Gorton
 Removed the atHarvestModule and the atManageModule as they are no longer required.

 26-02-2010 Bec Gorton
 Removed the following arrays:
 bm->NutsProd = Util_Alloc_Init_2D_Double(K_num_global_nonliving, EPIFAUNA, 0.0);
 bm->NutsProdGlobal = Util_Alloc_Init_3D_Double(K_num_global_nonliving, EPIFAUNA, nlevel_id, 0.0);
 bm->NutsLost = Util_Alloc_Init_2D_Double(K_num_global_nonliving, EPIFAUNA, 0.0);
 bm->NutsLostGlobal = Util_Alloc_Init_3D_Double(K_num_global_nonliving, EPIFAUNA, nlevel_id, 0.0);
 bm->DetritusProd = Util_Alloc_Init_2D_Double(K_num_global_nonliving, EPIFAUNA, 0.0);
 bm->DetritusProdGlobal = Util_Alloc_Init_3D_Double(K_num_global_nonliving, EPIFAUNA, nlevel_id, 0.0);
 bm->DetritusLost = Util_Alloc_Init_2D_Double(K_num_global_nonliving, EPIFAUNA, 0.0);
 bm->DetritusLostGlobal = Util_Alloc_Init_3D_Double(K_num_global_nonliving, EPIFAUNA, nlevel_id, 0.0);

 These are now stored in the BoxLayerValues structure that is allocated in Bio_Process - this
 stores values in the current box layer. Getting rid of the global arrays will assists us to
 move to a parallel platform in the future.
 Removed the atEcologyStructure from the model.

 01-03-2010 Bec Gorton
 Added variables to the MSEBoxModel structure to store information about larval dispersion.

 19-04-2010 Bec Gorton
 Increased the number of physical parameters that are sampled in the assessment module.

 17-05-2010 Bec Gorton
 Replaced the K_num_prod value with a check for isVertebrate = FALSE && IsDetritus = FALSE.
 Replaced the K_num_eat with with a check for isVertebrate = FALSE && isGrazer = TRUE.

 05-05-2010 Bec Gorton
 Added the mFC_scale_id definition so we can store the scaling value that should be aplied to the mFC value due to the broken-stick
 management strategy.
 Also added the definitions for the new temperature correction algorithm.

 07-05-2010 Bec Gorton
 Added additional species params to store the indices of each group (allow for adult and juv values for age structured groups)
 in the linear mortality scaling time series input file.
 Also added the new tslinearMort TimeSeries structure to the MSWBoxModel structure to store the new time series data and the function definitions
 readLinearMortalityTimeSeries to read in the time series data and Setup_Linear_Mortality_Indicies to link each group to the variables in the
 read in time series file.

 19-10-2010 Bec Gorton
 Removed the assessModule.h file. This is no longer required.
 Removed the K_num_invfished attribuute - this is now determined from the values in the functional group input file.

 08-11-2010 Bec Gorton
 Removed the atEconomic module.

 15-11-2010 Bec Gorton
 Removed references to K_num_charis.

 03-03-2011 Bec Gorton
 Added code to read in changes in mum and FSPB rates for vertebrates. Functionality documented on the Atlantis wiki at:
	https://wiki.csiro.au/confluence/display/Atlantis/2011/03/03/Changing+growth+rates+and+FSPB+over+time

 26-03-2011 Beth Fulton
 Added species specific starvation coefficients - mStarve

 16-08-2011 Beth Fulton
 Added DependDiscardsTot so that discards dependent on catch could be represented without the
 full harvest model being used

 03-10-2011 Beth Fulton
 Added bulkTAC, OldCatchSum, TotOldCumCatch, TotOldCumDiscards, tac_resetperiod_id, tac_resetcount_id to deal with multi-year TAC

 14-05-2012 Beth Fulton
 Added stuff for Savina seagrass model - including totagepop so can get age structured overall output

 21-06-2012 Bec Gorton
 Changed flageat_id to be a cohort dependant species flag.

 31-01-2013 Bec Gorton
 Added P as a nutrient. Removed the K_num_global_nonliving to be an enum and added P.

 05-07-2012 Bec Gorton
 Removed the TempSaltData structure as its not used anymore. We are using the PhyPropertyData structure.

 01-07-2013 Bec Gorton
 Added support to read in forcing netcdf files for any tracer in the model. The user needs to specify a missing_value value in the netcdf file. If the
 value for a given box/layer is 'missing_value' then it is ignored. Else the current tracer value for this box/layer is set to the value from the netcdf file
 and any existing value is overwritten.
 
 Also added support for an external mortality to be applied to a group. At present these values are never read in we just have the stub code to apply the mortality.
