/*
 *   atnamelist.h is a header file for the variable (tracer) ids/names
 *   for the ecological module in south east study
 *
 *   Author: Beth Fulton
 *   CSIRO Marine Laboratories
 *   2004
 *
 *   Revisions: 13/9/2004 Created msenamelist.h from the msebiolsetup.h file
 *
 *              21/9/2004 Created atnamelist.h from msenamelist.h. And renamed
 *				FSL, FSO, FSF, FST and FSG to generic names so apply to
 *				other models/generic case.
 *				FSL -> FDC  (Ling -> Demersal_DC_Fish)
 *				FSO -> FDO  (Orange_Roughy -> Demersal_O_Fish)
 *				FSF -> FDB  (Flathead -> Demersal_B_Fish)
 *				FST -> FVO  (Bluefin_Tuna -> Pisciv_O_Fish)
 *				FSG -> SHB  (Gummy_Shark -> Shark_B)
 *
 *              22/9/2004 Added age structure to cephalopods.
 *
 *              26/9/2004 Added Megazoobenthos
 *
 *              30/9/2004 Added Prawns
 *
 *              3/10/2004 Added index names for the additional biological groups
 *				(other filter feeders, megazoobenthos, estuarine demersal fish,
 *				flat deep demersal fish, benthopelagics, other piscivores, penguins,
 *				skates and rays, reptiles and dugongs) and their diagnostic variables
 *
 *				25/3/2005 Added 3 as option for TolFlag in namelist so that densities
 *              of vertebrates aren't set to min_pool in the adaptive differencing
 *				so that better handled during aging without creeping reintroductions.
 *
 *             	28/3/2005 Added Bioflag[ij] (indicating whether the variable is one
 *				that may be switched off and so should be set to 0.0 non min_pool)
 *				and Activeflag[ij] (flag indicating whether the variable is active
 *				or not) so that can better handle  groups that aren't active,
 *				so that avoid rounding errors in backwaters where the 1e-8 min_pools
 *				can accumulate through advection to be a problem.
 *
 *              28/05/2008 Bec Gorton
 *              The trnamelist array is now generated in atbuildTracer.c
 *              All of the vertebrate *_N_i, *_StructN_i, *_ResN_i and _Nums_i tracers
 *              are no longer used. The index values are stored directly into the
 *              tracer arrays associated with each functional group in the FunctionalGroupStruct
 *              structure.
 *
 *              13/06/2008 Bec Gorton
 *              Fixed a bug in the diagnamelist. The GelatZooProd and GelatZooGrazer were
 *              using the CarnivZoo index pointers.
 *                  Changeed:
 *                  {"GelatZooProdn",   &CarnivZooProdn_i, 0, 2, 0},
 *                  to
 *                  {"GelatZooProdn",   &GelatZooProdn_i, 0, 2, 0},
 *              and the same for Grazing.
 *
 *
 *              12/08/2008 Bec Gorton
 *              Added Light_Adaptn_SG_i and Light_Adaptn_MA_i. These will just be 0 but it will mean i can
 *              loop the call to PrimaryProduction.
 *
 *				22-04-2009 Bec Gorton
 *				Removed many tracer definitions that were no longer required.
 *
 *				25-01-2010 Bec Gorton
 *				Removed all the fish tracers as these are now automatically generated.
 *
 *				17-04-2013 Bec Gorton
 *				ATL-346 - Added support of tracking P:N:C ratios in groups.
